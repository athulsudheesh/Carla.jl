Welcome to Carla.jl documentation.

Competency-based Assessment using Robust Latent-transition Analysis (CARLA) is
a framework for modeling the evolution of a student's latent skills during the course
of a semester. Key objectives of this framework are:

1. Provide the course instructor with diagnostic information regarding the 
   probabilities of student's latent skill status 
2. Provide a psychometric framework for comparing and evaluating exam assessments 
   and instructional strategies with respect to student latent skill profiles
