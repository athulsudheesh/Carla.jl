Competency-based Assessment using Robust Latent-transition Analysis (CARLA) is a framework for modeling the evolution of a student's latent skills during the course of a semester. Key objectives of this framework are:

Provide the course instructor with diagnostic information regarding the probabilities of student's latent skill status
Provide a psychometric framework for comparing and evaluating exam assessments and instructional strategies with respect to student latent skill profiles
